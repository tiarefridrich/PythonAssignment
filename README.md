# PythonAssignment

This repository contains the script for the Big Data Analysis Python assignment created by Tiare Fridrich.
The original instructions were to create a Seq object that accepts a string, add a method to count kmers of size k,
add a method to create a pandas data frame containing possible k and observed k, add a method to produce a graph from the data frame,
add a method to calculate linguistic complexity, write a script to test each function, and then read the sequence data and output the results.
